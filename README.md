# BaristaBuddyAPIMaster
The API Repository for our Coffee Shop eCommerce application, Barista Buddy

## Overview
The performing database of our BaristaBuddy project is the API. Essentially the brain of the project. It stores the data which is input from the MVC as well as posting to there as well when asked.

Languages used are C# with ASP .NET Core.

## The API
The API acts as the brain or database of our entire app when it's run side-by-side with our MVC.

## Features
Within the BaristaBuddyAPI we have: Controllers, Models, Services, and View folders which house the various code which builds our app. Within that code are routes that allow the feeding of data to populate in the MVC.

The most notable features are that, when used, users can add, delete, update their items as well as do broad and specific searches in feeding information stored in the database to the MVC.

### Routes
The routes that we have are:
  - Store
  - Item
  - StoreModifier
  - itemModifer
  
### Database
The database in this API is complimented by the MVC. The information is input through a webbrowser when you run both programs together through different ports.


## Use
The use for the database is to store information which companies and parties with permissions can update, delete, and add information, same as the MVC.

The MVC is just the interface as the API is essentially justthe brain of the project.

## Future Developments
As this project develops throughout the alloted timeline more features and functionality will be implemented.
Features beiung worked on and applied are:
  - map location functionality
  - electronic payment methods
  - delivery integration
  - administrative options
  - login credentials and password encryption
